Digital Qur'an with authenticated Arabic text and parallel English translation

Arabic text provided via the Tanzil project: http://tanzil.net/wiki/Tanzil_Project

The English translation is an unedited version of Abdullah Yusuf Ali's work. It is our hope to eventually replace it with a more refined version and also add other translations, insha'Allah.

The code for this project is old but not yet considered stable. I do not recommend you use it in its current state. I've placed it here so that others who wish to contribute can improve upon it and ultimately produce something that will be useful for other projects involving the Qur'an and other Islamic texts with side-by-side translation in this style.

This is a project of the Bayt al-Hikmah Digital Islamic Library: http//www.baytalhikmah.org, hosted and funded by One Ummah Network: http://www.oneummah.net
